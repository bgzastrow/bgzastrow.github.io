				<h1>Ben Zastrow</h1>
				<p>I am a graduate student in the Aerospace Engineering department at the University of Texas at Austin, with a focus on controls.
					My research focuses on reduced order modeling for coupled aerostructural simulations, and I am advised by Professor Karen
					Willcox at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences.
				</p>
				<p>
					Is my local version working?
				</p>
				<p>I received my B.S. in Engineering Mechanics from the University of Wisconsin - Madison in 2018. While I was an undergraduate,
					I worked as a co-op student employee for ATA-Engineering in Spring 2015, Fall 2015, and Summer 2016, primarily supporting FEA modeling projects.
					In Summer 2017, I interned at Ford Motor Company in the brake control algorithms group. After graduating, I worked for ATA-Engineering for three years,
					where I mostly worked on structural dynamics and solid mechanics modeling.
